   <h1>The Feynman Technique: The Best Way to Learn Anything</h1>

   <p>There are four <a href="">simple steps</a> to the Feynman Technique, which I’ll explain below: <a href="">simple steps</a></p>

   <ul>
      <li>Choose a Concept</li>
      <li>Teach it to a Toddler</li>
      <li>Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material</li>
      <li>Review and Simplify (optional) </li>
   </ul>

   <p>If you’re not learning you’re standing still. So what’s the best way to learn new subjects and identify gaps in our existing knowledge?</p>

   <h2>Two Types of Knowledge</h2>

   <p>There are two types of knowledge and most of us focus on the wrong one. The first type of knowledge focuses on knowing the name of something. The second focuses on knowing something. These are not the same thing. The famous Nobel winning physicist Richard Feynman understood the difference between knowing something and knowing the name of something and it’s one of the most important reasons for his success. In fact, he created a formula for learning that ensured he understood something better than everyone else.</p>
